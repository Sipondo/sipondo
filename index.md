## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk) working on Resource-Aware Machine Learning. Before joining ITU, I studied at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where I graduated with a Masters degree in Data Science with a traineeship focussed on Massively-Parallel acceleration of Machine Learning (via graphics cards) at the University of Copenhagen.

My research focusses on improving accessibility and sustainability of Deep Learning. Notably, I am interested in how we can make reporting resource consumption a given instead of a nuisance. My current research focusses on improving the efficiency of training convolutional neural networks at a slight calculated cost in network performance. Besides Machine Learning, i am interested in the acceleration of algorithms and graphics via graphics cards. My PhD supervisor is [PÄ±nar Tozun](https://www.pinartozun.com/).
