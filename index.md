## About Me

I am a postdoc at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk) working on Resource-Aware Machine Learning. Before joining ITU, I studied at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where I graduated with a Masters degree in Data Science with a traineeship focussed on Massively-Parallel acceleration of Machine Learning (via graphics cards) at the University of Copenhagen.

My research focusses on improving accessibility and sustainability of Deep Learning. Notably, I am interested in how we can make reporting resource consumption a given instead of a nuisance. My current research focusses on improving the efficiency of data loading for training LLMs and convolutional networks. Besides Machine Learning, i am interested in the acceleration of algorithms and graphics via graphics cards. I did my Ph.D. in resource-aware data systems with [PÄ±nar Tozun](https://www.pinartozun.com/) as my supervisor.

As a researcher I am part of the [RAD (Resource-Aware Data Science) team](https://rad.itu.dk) which is part of the [DASYA (Data-Intensive Systems and Appplications)](https://dasya.itu.dk) group.
