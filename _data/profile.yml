  <p>
    I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://itu.dk" target="_blank">IT University of Copenhagen</a> working on Resource-Aware Machine Learning. Before joining ITU, I studied at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where I graduated with a Masters degree in Data Science with a traineeship focussed on Massively-Parallel acceleration of Machine Learning (via graphics cards) at the University of Copenhagen.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research focusses on improving accessibility and sustainability of Deep Learning. Notably, I am interested in how we can make reporting resource consumption a given instead of a nuisance. My current research focusses on improving the efficiency of data loading for training LLMs and convolutional networks. Besides Machine Learning, i am interested in the acceleration of algorithms and graphics via graphics cards. I did my Ph.D. in resource-aware data systems with <a href="https://www.pinartozun.com" target="_blank">Pınar Tozun</a> as my supervisor.
